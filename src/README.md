# Project 1: Tokenizer

Welcome to tokenizer, the tokenizer program will take user input and act
accordingly. The user has access to three commands being
- 'h' for history
- 'q' for quit
- "!x" which will go to index x in history and retreive it

the program will first take user input, check if its any of the commands, and
will start the process of tokenizing the string. The process starts by
counting the number of words,  then will allocate memory for a new string that
holds a word, and will be stored as a token. After this the string the user
inputted will be stored in a history list and the user will be able to see the
history using the 'h' command and it will be shown at the end of the
program.
